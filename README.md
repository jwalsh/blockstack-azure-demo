# Background 

This provisions the storage, blockstack<core> (routing and
virtualchain), and blockchain layers for Blockstack. 


# Installation 

This will duplicate some of the instructions covered in
https://github.com/blockstack/blockstack-integration-tests but with a
specific focus on creating a minimal web application that can be
deployed in addition to the Blockstack framework. 

# Getting Started 

```
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
./getting_started.sh
```
